					<h2>Boats and Watercraft Insurance</h2>
					<p>Most companies provide limited coverage for property damage for small boats such as canoes and small sail boats or small power boats with less than 25 mile per hour horse power under a homeowners or renters insurance policy. Larger and faster boats such as yachts, and personal watercraft such as jet skis and wave runners require a separate boat insurance policy.

					<h2>Apartments & Condominiums</h2>
					<p>Renters insurance provides financial protection against the loss or destruction of your possessions when you rent a house or apartment. By purchasing renters insurance, your possessions are covered against losses from fire or smoke, lightning, vandalism, theft, explosion, windstorm and water damage (not including floods). Renters insurance also covers your responsibility to other people injured at your home or elsewhere by you, a family member or your pet and pays legal defense costs if you are taken to court. Renters insurance may also covers your additional living expenses if you are unable to live in your apartment because of a fire or other covered peril.</p>
