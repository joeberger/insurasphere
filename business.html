			<h3>ABC Insurance Agency – Flood Insurance Programs</h3>
			<p>Can you imagine how expensive it would be to rebuild and finance your house or business and replace all of your belongings in case of a flood?  Did you know that most home and business insurance policies do not cover flood damage?  Let ABC Insurance Agency associates  help protect you from the potentially damaging financial effects by explaining the different ways we can help!</p>
			
			<p>The following is what you should consider when purchasing flood insurance:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>You should not solely rely on Federal Disaster Assistance for full protection</li>
			<li>Flood policies are provided by the Federal government; however they are administered by insurance companies. They're available in communities that have joined the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  Check to see if your community has joined by calling Sharer & Associates today, or checking on line at www.fema.gov/fema/csb.shtm</li>
			<li>Just a few inches of water from a flood can cause tens of thousands of dollars in damage. Over the past 10 years, the average flood claim has amounted to over $33,000.  To find out how much damage could occur in your home, visit  http://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/pages/flooding_flood_risks/the_cost_of_flooding.jsp.</li>
			
			<li>Flood insurance is available to homeowners, renters, condo owners/renters, and commercial owners/renters. Costs vary depending on how much insurance is purchased, what it covers, and the property's flood risk.</li>
			<li>Flood policy provides coverage for buildings and contents. However, you might want to consider whether to insure your personal property since contents coverage is optional.</li>
			<li>Typically, there's a 30-day waiting period - from date of purchase - before your policy goes into effect. That means now is the best time to buy flood insurance</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Flood Insurance</h2>
			<p>Flood insurance denotes the specific insurance coverage against property loss from flooding. To determine risk

			physical damage to your insured property up to the replacement cost or Actual Cash Value (ACV) (See "How Flood
			Damages Are Valued") of the actual damages or the policy limit of liability, whichever is less.</p>

			<h2>Health, Life, Disability & Casualty Insurance</h2>
			<p>A health insurance policy is a binding contract issued by an insurance company to an individual or group which
			promises to pay for health care reasonably required by the "insured" or "policy holder" or "certificate holder" to treat
			illness or injury.</p>
			<p>Life insurance is a contract between the policy holder and the insurer, where the insurer promises to pay a
			designated beneficiary a sum of money (a "premium") upon the death of the insured person.
			Disability Insurance, often called DI or disability income insurance, is a form of insurance that insures the
			beneficiary's earned income against the risk that a disability will make working, (and therefore earning), impossible. It
			includes paid sick leave, short-term disability benefits, and long-term disability benefits
			Casualty insurance covers losses and liabilities which are a result of unforeseen accidents. This category of insurance
			is quite broad, encompassing a range of situations and fields within the insurance industry. Generally, casualty
			insurance excludes life, health, and fire insurance policies; it is designed for things like burglary, terrorist attacks, and
			fraud.</p>

			<h2>Product Liability Insurance</h2>
			<p>Product Liability Insurance covers the business from claims related to the manufacture or sale of products, food,
			medicines or other goods to the public. Product Liability Insurance makes a special area of law (Consumer Protection
			Act 1987), according to which manufacturers, as well as distributors, suppliers, retailers, and other people who make
			products available to the public, are held liable in case their products are not "fit for purpose" and their use, misuse,
			or handling cause bodily injury or illness to a third party, or loss or damage to the third party's property.</p>

			<h3>ABC Insurance Agency -Product Liability Insurance Programs</h3>
			<p>Whether you are a manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, or retailer, you are held responsible for the safety of a product or service you provide. Businesses can be sued for a substantial amount of damages and need the proper protection from potential professional and product liability risks. </p>
			
			<p>It is crucial to understand the potential liability in order to determine the importance of Product Liability Insurance for you. Basically, there are three types of products "claims" a business may face:</p>
			
			<ol>
			<li>Manufacturing or Production Flaws, when consumers claim that due to some part of the production process, the product has an unsafe defect.</li>
			<li>Design Defect, when consumers find the design of the product unsafe.</li>
			<li>Defective Warnings or Instructions, when the product is claimed not properly labeled or lacking adequate warnings for consumers to realize the risk.</li>
			</ol>
			<p> Product Liability claims can be serious enough to ruin one's business. The types of claims mentioned above are associated with medical costs, economic damages, compensatory damages, attorneys' fees, and punitive damages.</p>
			<p>Make sure that your policy coverage amounts are sufficient to protect you if some serious injury is involved. A million dollars of coverage is considered about the minimum. It is a mistake to think that you cannot be sued if you are insured. Note that even in cases where the retailer is released from a suit, the legal process can be very lengthy and costly and you need the policy which covers these expenses.</p>
			<p> ABC Insurance Agency  offers product liability insurance to indemnify you from damages or injury to an individual or another business due to the failure or misuse of your product or a product you are selling. Our professionals can help identify your risk exposures and design a complete product liability program to safeguard your company.
